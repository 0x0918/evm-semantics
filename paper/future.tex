\section{Future Work}
While we have made initial efforts towards formal verification of smart
contracts, there is still much work to be done to verify all of their nuanced
properties. Our primary goal is to finish implementing the remainder of the
instructions in EVM, and including more contract properties beyond functional
correctness. A simple example of this may be determining gas bounds on EVM
programs, or detecting common classes of bugs in EVM programs. To this end, we also plan to build
semantics for mining blocks; without such semantics, we would not be able to
detect bugs in the class of transaction order dependence. We aim to use our full EVM
semantics to then model higher level languages, such as Serpent~\cite{serpent}
and Solidity~\cite{solidity}, which smart contracts are almost ubiquitously
written in. Doing so will enable verification of the compile step from these higher
level languages to EVM. Ultimately, we aim to routinely apply our
verification techniques to the \textit{entire Ethereum blockchain}, and
publish the resultant dataset back to the security and cryptocurrency
communities.
