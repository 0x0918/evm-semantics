\section{Future Work}
While we have made significant efforts towards formal verification of smart
contracts, there is still much work to be done to verify all of the nuanced properties
of smart contracts. Our future work is split into a few stages,

\subsection{Finish Implementing semantics of EVM Instructions}
\subsection{Enforce rules on more global properties}
\subsection{Check for common things that cause bugs in EVM programs}
