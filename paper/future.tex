\section{Future Work}
While we have made initial efforts towards formal verification of smart
contracts, there is still much work to be done to verify all of their nuanced
properties. Our primary goal is to finish implementing the remainder of the
instructions in EVM, and including more contract properties besides correctness
and gas in our verification techniques. In addition, we aim to use our full EVM
semantics to then model higher level languages, such as Serpent~\cite{serpent}
and Solidity~\cite{solidity}, which smart contracts are almost ubiquitously
written in. Doing so will enable verification of the compiler from these higher
level languages to EVM. Ultimately, we aim to routinely apply our
verification techniques to the \textit{entire Ethereum blockchain}, and
publish the resultant dataset back to the security and cryptocurrency
communities.
