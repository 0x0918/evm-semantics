\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we contribute a formalization of the EVM semantics in \K{},
demonstrate verification of correctness on a simple EVM program that contains
inter-contract interaction. As interest in formal verification of EVM programs
grows, we hope that our contributions will pave the way for consistent and
accurate verification of smart contracts, ultimately leading to a bug-free and
secure environment for further cryptocurrency development.
