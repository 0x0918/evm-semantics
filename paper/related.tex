\section{Related Work} Luu et al.\cite{luumaking} formalized a subset of EVM
semantics, and used a symbolic execution tool based on their formalized
semantics to detect problems in 8519 existing smart contracts. Their semantics
however, are incomplete, and can only be used to detect a limited class of
problems. For instance, their semantics do not consider the role of gas in
Ethereum transactions, and cannot be used to prove properties concerning gas on
smart contracts.

There exists extensive literature on the use of language semantics for program
verification. Stefanescu et al.
\cite{stefanescu-park-yuwen-li-rosu-2016-oopsla} in their work presented a
language independent verification framework for program verification. The
verification infrastructure presented in their work however, has to be
initialized with the operational semantics of the language. Hence, having
complete semantics of EVM in K would allow for using existing infrastructure
for smart contracts verification.

Maude NPA, some papers there. Inspiring sort of ideas sort of deal.

Oyente - They propose EtherLite language as a safe subset of EVM, we should
point out that it's very easy in K to circle the part of the definition of the
language. It's quite extensible.

There are debuggers for EVM, and symbolic executions for EVM, but without a full
understanding
