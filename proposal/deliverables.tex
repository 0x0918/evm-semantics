\section{Deliverables and Timeline}

\subsection{Build EVM state model}
\noindent\emph{Target deadline: October 14}\\[6pt]
We have begun creating a K configuration with cells for the actual EVM code, program counter, gas counter, auxiliary memory, program memory stack, and contract storage.
We do not initially model the entire blockchain state because we are first interested in the isolated properties of the transaction itself. 
Contracts that call other contracts can still work within our initial model because we abstract the network/blockchain layer and evaluate each dependent contract separately, with an appropriate starting state. 

\subsection{Model Oyente subset and gas}
\noindent\emph{Target deadline: November 12}\\[6pt]
We plan to first model EtherLite --- the EVM subset modeled by Oyente --- and contract gas consumption (not including block gas limits).
EtherLite consists of the following opcodes: 
\begin{itemize}
	\renewcommand\labelitemi{--}
	\itemsep0.2em
	\item Stop and arithmetic
	\item Comparison \& bitwise logic
	\item Push/pop stack
	\item Memory and storage load/store
	\item Call, return, suicide
	\item Contract gas checking
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Verify Oyente Results}
\noindent\emph{Target deadline: November 19}\\[6pt]
To validate our correct modeling of EtherLite with gas, we will first verify the results generated by Oyente and aim to improve upon the reported 7\% false positive rates for transaction ordering dependence, timestamp dependence, and mishandled exceptions.

\subsection{Formal gas verification}
\noindent\emph{Target deadline: November 26}\\[6pt]
With the addition of gas modeling to EtherLite, we plan to verify that smart contracts do not have \textit{unintended gas input dependence}, and also determine the upper and lower \textit{gas consumption bounds}.

\subsection{Model additional EVM opcodes}
\noindent\emph{Target deadline: December 16}\\[6pt]
We will add full EVM state tracking to include blocks and the Ethereum blockchain, and add the following op codes:
\begin{itemize}
	\renewcommand\labelitemi{--}
	\itemsep0.2em
	\item Block Information
	\item Environmental Information
	\item System Operations
	\item Other Stack, Memory, Storage, and Flow Operations
	\item Duplication Operations
	\item Exchange Operations
	\item SHA3 Keccak-256 Hash
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Broader Verification}
\noindent\emph{Target deadline: December 31}\\[6pt]
With EVM fully modeled, we can run a wide range of formal verifications on Ethereum contracts, including the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\renewcommand\labelitemi{--}
	\itemsep0.2em
	\item Checking EVM interpreter correctness
	\item Call stack depth (the DAO hack)
	\item Empty terminal balance 
	\item Valid address calls
\end{itemize}
