\section{Related Work}
Luu et al.\cite{luumaking} formalized a subset of EVM semantics, and used a symbolic execution tool based on their formalized semantics to detect problems in 8519 existing smart contracts. Their semantics however, are incomplete, and can only be used to detect a limited class of problems. For instance, their semantics don't consider the role of  gas in ethereum transactions, and cannot be used to prove properties concerning gas on smart contracts. 

There exists extensive literature on the use of language semantics for program verification. Stefanescu et al. \cite{stefanescu-park-yuwen-li-rosu-2016-oopsla} in their work presented a language independent verification framework for program verification. The verification infrastructure presented in their work however, has to be initialized with the operational semantics of the language. Hence, having complete semantics of EVM in K would allow for using existing infrastructure for program verification.
