\section{Contingency Plan}

The main concern regarding project completion is the amount of time it will take us to model EtherLite, and eventually, all of EVM. We are working closely with the developers of the K framework and will be able to get help when needed. A subsidiary concern is the computation power required to perform verification across all EVM contracts.
We have some limited computation power available to us, but may need assistance with acquiring more compute power via cloud hosted computing service such as Amazon.
